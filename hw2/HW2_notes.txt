Need to set matlab environment to current folder for code to run correctly

Number of vertices in each face must be the same
    didnt notice in instructions
    solve this by repeating last point until size is filled

Script vertices for each rotor circle
    center on arm locations

Simulation clock is located in simulink model of drawVehicle,
    not main simulation diagram

Rotor Color coding:
front=north=green
back=-north=red
right=east=blue
left=-east=cyan

Switching order of rotation and translation has no effect on final
position/orientation since these inputs are global.
    Switching order does change orientation of quad while translating:
        Level or pitched while translating
